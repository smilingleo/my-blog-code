## QueryTemplate Refactoring

Given 
* the UserSessionBean.zuoraOrgId is provided.
* the OrgContext
* ~~User's org (not needed since the UserSession construction has guaranteed the user's org can be covered.)

The OrgContext should have higher priority, if there is no OrgContext, we will honor the UserSession.`zuoraOrgId` and `returnNestedOrgData` flag

So, `the QueryInterceptorTemplate.getTagIdsOfAllVisibleOrgs` should always use UserSession to construct the visible orgs, which should be a subset of the user's visible org ids.
